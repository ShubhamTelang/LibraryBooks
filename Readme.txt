Hello,
    Here is the Django project that can perform CRUD operations. I have linked the database with mysql and it can
    perform CRUD operations. I can use Github. And as i am not good with frontend applications so i have not made any frontend user interface
    but the given code can perform CRUD operations using Django's browsable API service. I have started learning frontendtechnology
    such as HTML5 and CSS.


Mysql operations-
    create a new database/schema with name 'Books' with user 'root' and password '9767441488'.

Django operations-
    You can get data from django and database using address- http://127.0.0.1:8000/list/ to get all the data from database.
    To get single data use this link http://127.0.0.1:8000/1/ just change the value '1' and you can get data for single book.
    you can add a book or delete a book or update a book.
